## DRIVING LICENSE 
 
Having a car is important in Baltimore, especially because we rotate in different hospitals.  

IMPORTANT: to apply for a driving license, you MUST have your SSN already.  

### New driver (Do not have a foreign driving license):  
 
1)	You need to apply for a Maryland learner permit. A learner's permit allows a new driver to begin the learning process of operating a motor vehicle. For a complete list of documents you can bring and to schedule your appointment, visit our Online Document Guide. 
2)	Once you get your learner's permit, you can schedule your driving knowledge testing. You can use the “MD practice driving test” app to study (Appstore or Play Store).  You don’t need the course to do the driving knowledge test, but it is advised.  
3)	Before/while you are awaiting your learner's permit, you must enroll in a Driver's Education Course. This consists of a minimum of 30hr of classroom instruction and 6 hr. behind-wheel instruction training.  The Maryland driving school will electronically submit verification of completion to the MVA.  This certificate is needed to schedule your driving skill test.  
4)	Academies you can use: [Greg's Driving School](https://www.gregsdrivingschool.net/) (Multiple locations), [National Driving school](https://www.nationaldrivingschool.net/) - or call Mr. Nassar Khan – 443-3266813).
