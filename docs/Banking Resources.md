## CREDIT CARD / CREDIT-SCORE 
 
Establishing a good credit score isn’t a complex process, but it’s vital for your overall financial picture. When you have a good or excellent credit score, you’ll have an easier time being approved for renting an apartment, you’ll get better rates on car and homeowner’s insurance and it’s cheaper to borrow money when you need it.  
Having a good credit score can be especially helpful when facing an unexpected financial crisis, like a lay off. When lenders see you as a trustworthy borrower, you’re more likely to receive favorable offers for 0% financing if you’re ever in a pinch.

### Good ways to start building a credit score:  
 
Get a credit card: Some easy cards to get at the beginning based on residents' experiences are DISCOVER, CAPITAL ONE QUICKSILVER, DCU visa.
