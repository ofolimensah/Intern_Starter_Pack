# Welcome to the MedStar IM-Baltimore Family!   

With the help of many residents, your upcoming chiefs (Maria, Batool, Bassem, Albert, and Shiavax) created this general guideline to discuss some topics we consider important to know at this stage.  
 
We want to acknowledge that some topics may not apply to you if you are U.S. citizen / green card holder (E.g. SSN, driving license…) or if you are already settled in the area/ country (E.g. Car, housing, bank account).  Although we wanted to include all the information to help ALL OF YOU as much as we can.  
 
We also want to acknowledge that this guide was obtained from our research and residents’ / our experiences. This does not represent MedStar Health organization's opinion.
