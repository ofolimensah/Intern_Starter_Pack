Table of Contents About the Program Orientation Schedules Policies and Procedures Resources About the Program We are one of the largest internal medicine community programs in the country, with an affiliation to Georgetown University. Baltimore has a diverse patient population and our residents have the opportunity and responsibility to take care of the community at four different hospitals. Our affiliated hospitals, where residents complete their core inpatient, ambulatory and elective rotations are MedStar Franklin Square Hospital, MedStar Union Memorial Hospital, MedStar Harbor Hospital and MedStar Good Samaritan Hospital. Each hospital caters to different geographical regions of Baltimore with their own unique patient population. This allows our residents to learn from a variety of excellent faculty and see a wide breadth of pathology. Our residents are divided into 3 Firms (Thomas, Stevens, Mulholland) and are on inpatient teams and ICU with residents from the same firm. Each firm also has a full-time chief resident to provide administrative support. While you\u2019re in our residency program, your firm will become your work family. Firm members work with each other often and support each other.
